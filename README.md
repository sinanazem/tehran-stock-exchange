## Tehran Stock Exchange Data Pipeline Project
This project focuses on creating a data pipeline to crawl the watchlist data from the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), transforming it, and loading it into a data lake for further analysis. The pipeline is designed to automate the process of collecting stock data, ensuring it is structured appropriately, and making it readily available for analytical purposes.
